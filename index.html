            <h4>The Bombay Scottish School has excelled, for over 169 years, in providing fine education, to the pupils entrusted to its care. In these years that have gone by, the School endeavored kindling a fire in the young minds of its pupils, preparing them for a world of tomorrow, full of challenges, so that in the words of Plato â€˜they may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.â€™

                The School follows the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) up to the tenth grade and the Indian School Certificate (ISC) for the eleventh and twelfth grades. The School encourages the pupils to inculcate the two qualities which symbolize the Scottish character, achieving success by means of honest and strenuous effort and placing complete faith in God.

                The School pays special attention to needs of students with learning difficulties through sustained attention provided by specially trained staff. The student body of 3300 boys and girls is divided into four Houses viz Yellow House, Green House, Red House and Blue House.

        "What makes a child gifted and talented may not always be good grades in school, but a different way of looking at the world and learning." ----- Chuck Grassley
        
        The 'Scottish Spotlight' was organized for grades 1 to 12 as an endeavour to give our SCOTTISHITES a platform to enhance and showcase their talents. It was held on Friday, 18th December 2020 from 9:00 a.m. onwards.
        
        It was a four stage competition which covered the areas of Fine Arts, Performing Arts, Literary Arts and Tech Connect. The participants were from Grades 6 to 12. Like all events in Scottish, this event was also a grand success owing to the whole-hearted, meticulous planning and support of the entire SCOTTISH FAMILY.
        
        The preparations started about ten days prior and different committees were set up for different events. The Public Relations Team comprising the students created a lot of awareness and excitement by preparing e-posters and pamphlets informing everybody about the upcoming fest, and contact details of the different club heads were shared.
        
        Thereafter, discussions commenced, different WhatsApp groups were made and the selection process started. After the selection process was completed, students were assigned the tasks and were asked to prepare for the events accordingly.
        
        All the Scottishites were very excited and the participation was overwhelming. Despite the inhibitions that we had about pulling off such a grand event online, we were amazed as to how smoothly the event was carried out without any glitches.
        
        All thanks to the amazing efforts of all the staff, students, and the unwavering support of the Administrative Heads of the School and last, but not the least, our dear parents who are more than willing to do their best for the upliftment and betterment of this great institution.
        
        The Scottish Spotlight was our closing event for the year 2020 and it just left all of us feeling grateful and privileged for everything that we have. It set the right mood for the Christmas holidays, but the one thing it taught us, is that NOTHING CAN STOP A SCOTTISHITE and we shall only move ONWARD and UPWARD.

        <h4>School History
            The formation of Bombay Scottish School began in 1847 when the Scottish Christian missionaries established the â€˜Scottish Female Orphanageâ€™ at Byculla, for benefit of the daughters of Presbyterian soldiers and Indian Navy Seamen. The success of this first institution led to the establishment of the â€˜Orphanage for the Sons of Presbyteriansâ€™ in 1856. These two humble institutions were united in 1859 under the name of the â€˜Bombay Presbyterian Male and Female Orphanageâ€™. The name was changed in 1863 to the â€˜Bombay Scottish Orphanageâ€™.

            In 1867, a society with its own constitution, and rules and regulations, was formed. A new constitution was adopted in 1886 and since then the Society is known as the â€˜Bombay Scottish Orphanage Societyâ€™. With the principal objective of equipping the children to take their place in the society, a large plot of land was acquired on the beautiful Mahim Bay. The Government of Bombay in 1875 approved construction of the boarding school building designed by D E Gostling, F R I B A and J Morris. The construction of the building commenced on 8th December 1875 by his Excellency, the Honourable Sir Philip Edmond Wodehouse, the then Governor and President in Council and was completed on 28th February 1878, at a cost of Rs 84,015. The facility was opened to use by his Excellency, the Hon. Sir Richard Temple Bart, G C S I the then Governor and President in Council.

            In the early years the student strength was a mere 30 odd. As classes were added and the standard of education effectively upgraded, the Orphanage was elevated to the position of a high school and went by the name â€˜The Bombay Scottish Orphanage High Schoolâ€™. When the Orphanage was closed down its name was changed to â€˜The Bombay Scottish Schoolâ€™.
